I'm an engineer who should probably have gone into computer science. 

I specialize in machine learning, large data analysis and digitalization and like to examine the world through data to see how it reflects our perceptions. I love learning about how technology can provide better user experiences and am always looking to learn new things.

I currently live in Iceland with my partner and dog, spend my time hiking and running and working on side projects in the evenings.
