I'm an engineer who should probably have gone into computer science. 

I specialize in machine learning, large data analysis and digitalization and like to examine the world through data to see how it reflects our perceptions. I love learning about how technology can provide better user experiences and am always looking to learn new things.

I currently live in Iceland with my partner and dog, spend my time hiking and running and working on side projects in the evenings.

If you want to hear more about my projects, tell me about yours or just say hi then [drop me a line](mailto:sagaulfars@gmail.com)
